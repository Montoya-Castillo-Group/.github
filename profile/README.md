## Hi there 👋
We are building a dynamic group of scientists harnessing multidisciplinary skills that span physical chemistry, condensed matter physics, and quantum information science. We are looking for enthusiastic graduate students & postdocs interested in tackling problems of charge and energy transfer dynamics in the condensed phase that underpin forefront areas of chemistry such as catalysis at electrode surfaces, solar energy conversion, and quantum computing.

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
